# decentr-health-app

A 3 part suite to make up a decentralized Health Record system, takes advantage of the already published bitcoin whitepaper to build a similiar transaction system but replaces all major inputs with health related data.

Comes packed with a Mobile Client to track health records and hold patient private key, Desktop Client for organizations to manage their patients records and edit them, and a blockchain server and miner.
